                <p>My name is Neringa Ivanov and curently I am a Multimedia Design student. I am 20 years old and I am from Romania.
                    About myself I can say that I am passionate about art, I love dogs, coffee, traveling, spending time with my friends and family.
                    Also I like fluffy things!</p>

                <p>Being a foreign student in Denmark, well let me tell you, is challenging. I started a new life, I met new people, I am adjusting to a new system.
                    But every change is for the better.</p>

                <p>First semester as Multimedia Designer was harder than I thought. Everything was new for me, I have never worked with HTML, CSS or Illustrator. It was like discovering new lands. In spite of everythin and every challange I tried my best to accomplish every task. In the end I put my achieved knowledge in this site which you can see the projects that I worked on individualy or in groups.</p>
